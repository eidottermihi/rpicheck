If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.
If your code is *deliberately* accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level.

        summary="Wrong locale name"
        explanation="From the `java.util.Locale` documentation:
&quot;Note that Java uses several deprecated two-letter codes. The Hebrew (&quot;he&quot;) language code is rewritten as &quot;iw&quot;, Indonesian (&quot;id&quot;) as &quot;in&quot;, and Yiddish (&quot;yi&quot;) as &quot;ji&quot;. This rewriting happens even if you construct your own Locale object, not just for instances returned by the various lookup methods.

Because of this, if you add your localized resources in for example `values-he` they will not be used, since the system will look for `values-iw` instead.

To work around this, place your resources in a `values` folder using the deprecated language code instead."

        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly.

    <issue
        id="ContentDescription"
        severity="Warning"
        message="[Accessibility] Missing `contentDescription` attribute on image"
        category="Accessibility"
        priority="3"
        summary="Image without `contentDescription`"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.

Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute.
